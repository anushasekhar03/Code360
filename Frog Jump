Problem statement
There is a frog on the '1st' step of an 'N' stairs long staircase. The frog wants to reach the 'Nth' stair. 'HEIGHT[i]' is the height of the '(i+1)th' stair.If Frog jumps 
from 'ith' to 'jth' stair, the energy lost in the jump is given by absolute value of ( HEIGHT[i-1] - HEIGHT[j-1] ). If the Frog is on 'ith' staircase, he can jump either 
to '(i+1)th' stair or to '(i+2)th' stair. Your task is to find the minimum total energy used by the frog to reach from '1st' stair to 'Nth' stair.

For Example
If the given ‘HEIGHT’ array is [10,20,30,10], the answer 20 as the frog can jump from 1st stair to 2nd stair (|20-10| = 10 energy lost) and then a jump from 2nd stair to last
stair (|10-20| = 10 energy lost). So, the total energy lost is 20.

            return dp[ind];
        }
        int left = fun(ind-1,heights,dp)+Math.abs(heights[ind]-heights[ind-1]);
        int right= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        if(ind>1){
            right = fun(ind-2,heights,dp)+Math.abs(heights[ind]-heights[ind-2]);
        }
        dp[ind]=Math.min(left,right);
        return dp[ind];
    }
    public static int frogJump(int n, int heights[]) {
        int dp[]=new int [n];
        Arrays.fill(dp,-1);
        return fun(n-1,heights,dp);
    }
}

Example Walkthrough:
Given the array of heights: heights[] = {30, 10, 60, 10, 60, 50}

Start at stone 0 (height 30) with zero energy.
From stone 0, the frog can either:
Jump to stone 1 (height 10), energy cost = |30 - 10| = 20.
From stone 1:
Jump to stone 2 (height 60), energy cost = |10 - 60| = 50.
Or, jump to stone 3 (height 10), energy cost = |10 - 10| = 0 (this is a better option).
From stone 3:
Jump to stone 4 (height 60), energy cost = |10 - 60| = 50.
Or, jump to stone 5 (height 50), energy cost = |10 - 50| = 40.
The goal is to minimize the total energy, and dp[] stores the minimum energy required for each stone as the frog moves.
